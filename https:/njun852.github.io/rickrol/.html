    <b>Never Gonna Give You Up Lyrics</b>
 </head>
 <body>
    <p>We're no strangers to love<br/>
You know the rules and so do I<br/>
A full commitment's what I'm thinking of<br/>
You wouldn't get this from any other guy<br/></p>

<p>I just want to tell you how I'm feeling<br/>
Gotta make you understand</p>

<p>Never gonna give you up, never gonna let you down<br/>
Never gonna run around and desert you<br/>
Never gonna make you cry, never gonna say goodbye<br/>
Never gonna tell a lie and hurt you</p><br/>

<p>We've known each other for so long<br/>
Your heart's been aching but you're too shy to say it<br/>
Inside we both know what's been going on<br/>
We know the game and we're gonna play it</p><br/>

<p>And if you ask me how I'm feeling<br/>
Don't tell me you're too blind to see</p><br/>

<p>Never gonna give you up, never gonna let you down<br/>
Never gonna run around and desert you<br/>
Never gonna make you cry, never gonna say goodbye<br/>
Never gonna tell a lie and hurt you</p><br/>

<p>Never gonna give you up, never gonna let you down<br/>
Never gonna run around and desert you<br/>
Never gonna make you cry, never gonna say goodbye<br/>
Never gonna tell a lie and hurt you</p><br/>

<p>(Ooh give you up)<br/>
(Ooh give you up)<br/>
(Ooh) Never gonna give, never gonna give (give you up)<br/>
(Ooh) Never gonna give, never gonna give (give you up)</p><br/>

<p>We've known each other for so long<br/>
Your heart's been aching but you're too shy to say it<br/>
Inside we both know what's been going on<br/>
We know the game and we're gonna play it</p><br/>

<p>I just want to tell you how I'm feeling<br/>
Gotta make you understand</p><br/>

<p>Never gonna give you up, never gonna let you down<br/>
Never gonna run around and desert you<br/>
Never gonna make you cry, never gonna say goodbye<br/>
Never gonna tell a lie and hurt you<br/></p>
